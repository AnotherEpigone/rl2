# RL2

RL2 is my second prototype roguelike.

Written in C#, using SadConsole 9 for graphics, and GoRogue 3 for map utilities.

## Compiling

Relies on the unreleased library [TheSadRogue.Integration](https://github.com/thesadrogue/TheSadRogue.Integration). You'll have to clone it manually to compile for now (will be nugetized soonTM).
